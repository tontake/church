# TheoApp Web Application (Wings of Prayer Region)
### This is a web application for wings of prayer region bulawayo
### It has been built with css,html, bootstrap and jquery and php mysql
### This project was birthed due to the covid-19 pandemic and acts as a benchmark for mobile app called TheoApp, it will provide all the api calls required to make a full fledged church software
### It has been built with the mission of providing access to resources to church members and non-members as a way of fostering distant coverage and hence a church beyong the walls 
### This is my first web app for churchs and therefore it has been built with love and will open door for more web application
